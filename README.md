# ImGuiSharp
ImGuiSharp is a binding library for [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for C# that aims to expose as many apis as possible and stay at the most updated version of imgui and cimgui and exposing internal headers.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning**: This is a beta version, and is not yet ready for use.‚ö†Ô∏è

üî¥**Observation**: The native library is only compiled for Windows-x64 and only tested on windows for now.üî¥
